  # NOTE(negz): This is a risky target, but we run this action only when and if
  # a PR is closed, then filter down to specifically merged PRs. We also don't
  # invoke any scripts, etc from within the repo. I believe the fact that we'll
  # be able to review PRs before this runs makes this fairly safe.
